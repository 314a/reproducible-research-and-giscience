Our algorithm is available on Github and is licensed under LGPL, so I wonder why you decided on code 1. I would have expected code 3, as it is available, open and permanent.
2. Our paper uses Java (open source if OpenJDK is used) and CityGML4j (free and open source) as the only 3rd part library. Albeit not tested, it should be running on pretty much any standard system, Windows. Linux etc. I would have expected to be classified as class 3.
3. Our algorithm itself does not need preprocessing on the data we used in the study. The data processing for evaluating the algorithm (removing random faces of the building models, etc.) is quite trivial and documented within the paper and should be easily recreatable. I would have expected code 1."")",,

- provide the raw collected data for the plots
- provide details on the AMI (i.e. configuration file) etc.

- be a lot more specific when it comes to used versions and configurations
- provide the actual used data and algorithm"
